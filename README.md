### Node.js and API Practice



## In this assignment, I was able to use an API platform named Postman to test multiple endpoints. For Example;
* Created a new student using POST
* Updated a student by ID using PUT
* Deleted a student by using DELETE
* Display a single student by using GET
* Dislay all the students by using GET
